I am finally at the end of my Sinatra project. It took me a while to get to this point, but I am proud to say I got through it. With Covid-19 it has been a bit of a struggle among other things. I am so proud of what I have accomplished. My app still needs a lot more work, but I will leave that for another day. It was a lot of fun working on this project compared to the CLI because I was able to see it work outside the terminal. I also find myself really enjoying making sure the user experience is a good one when they visit my app. I will discuss a little of what my project does. So, I could not figure out what I wanted to do my project on. Finally, it occurred to me while having a conversation with my husband who is a collector of comics and action figures. He has no system in place for his items. We have no idea what his current inventory looks like. So that is how I came to build my collectors digest app. It is an app where a user can input all their collectables and add any new ones they may purchase or remove and edit what they currently have. They can also see what others may have. One of my goals after completing the program is to circle back to this and maybe add where there is communication between users if there is interest in another userâ€™s item. So, there you have it!
