For my rails project I decided to think of something to do that im personally interested in. Due to COVID I am not able to join an intramural sports team which sparked my idea. This project has really challenged me. It has taken me months to finally get here. Some tips i can give is first sit in on some project study groups. See what questions other students may have because they may end up coming up when you are in the process of doing the project. Next watch some project playlists that are provided. They are extremely helpful. Third is to take project planning serious. Its important to lay out your project before you actually start to code. It makes the process a little easier when you know the flow of your apploxation. My next tip I would say is to really utilize every resource. I regret not reaching out to the Slack channel. I recently just started putting myself out there. I used to be afraid and embarassed. Not sure because all these other students have been where I'm sitting. That amount of support from other students is incredible. And section leads are out there too and will respond. so definetly become familiar with the channel if not already. My last tip is to HAVE FUN!! This is exciting creating something that you've been building up to. And this will most likely be something that goes in your portfolio and if you are passionate about it employers will see that. And you will most likely work more to make it as good as you can get it.
