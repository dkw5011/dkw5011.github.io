I have finally completed my first project!! It took me so long to get to this point. I was beginning to think I wouldn't make it. My full time job has been exhausting and then I was pregnant with my second child. There were many times I thought of giving up. The support I got from my husband, the Flatiron staff, and just other students really helped me get through this. I'm a mom now to a 8 week old baby boy and a firecracker 2.5 year old daughter. It has definitely been rough haha. 

So when I finally reached the point of deciding what I would do my project on I did something that would relate to me. Something I would find extremely useful. I built a CLI project on this years top baby products. 

I have 5 major points that I would give to those like myself who are scared to start the first project or just struggling with it. 

1. Do a flow chart of the program you are creating from beginning to end.
2. Write out pseudo code first.
3. Take advantage of binding pry.
4. Join the slack project channel.
5. Try to create something that relates to you.
